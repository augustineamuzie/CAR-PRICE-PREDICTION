# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION
# AIML Assessment: car prediction models
# Code file was prepared using jupyter notebook
# necessary libraries to import
# NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn (preprocessing, model selection, regression models, feature selection, pipelines, and evaluation metrics), and datetime
# To run the Python file, ensure all required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn) are installed and that the dataset file is correctly placed in the project directory. Open a terminal or Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the Python file, and execute it using the Python command. The script will run the preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation steps automatically, with results displayed in the console or saved within the project directory.
